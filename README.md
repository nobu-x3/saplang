# !DISCLAIMER
This is not a C-KILLER. I have no aspirations for this language to become popular or even used by other people. I'm developing it for my own projects and according to my tastes and needs.

# Goal
After coding in C and C++ for some time, I've come to the conclusion that both of the languages are not perfect. I've been searching and trying out different 'C/C++-killers' for a while but I still have not found a language that satisfies me. So I decided to build my own.
Saplang is built on top of the foundation that is C with some features inspired by C++. The end-goal is to have a language with the following features and qualities:
* Minimal syntactic differences to C.
* Full C-interop.
* 'defer' keyword.
* Modules.
* Build system written in Saplang.
* Comptime.
* MAYBE! Reflection as a language feature.
